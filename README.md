# Design history for GOV.UK services

A place for you to document your GOV.UK service designs.

## Purpose of this project

This repository makes it easy to:

* screenshot your designs
* create pages of screenshots to document designs
* document designs using the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/)
* print pages of designs
* make designs shareable and linkable

## Installation and getting started

Read our guide on how to [set up a design history](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-design-history/get-started/).

## Support

This project is maintained by a small number of volunteers working across government.

For questions about using a design history for your service, bug reports or feedback, [submit a new issue](https://github.com/x-govuk/govuk-design-history-template/issues/new).

## Technical notes

The design history uses the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk) and the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) static site generator with the [GOV.UK Eleventy Plugin](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-eleventy-plugin/).
