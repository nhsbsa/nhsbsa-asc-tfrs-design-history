## Why we did this work
Towards the end of May 2024 and start of June 2024 we designed into the service a option of a 60/40 funding model for eligible training (which is described in the post "Designing for a different funding model - 60/40"). During this work we had two conflicting mental models how we thought usres might think about the 60/40 claim:
- 1 claim in 2 parts
- 2 separate claims that are linked

Given the time constraints we were under we started with the simpler to design option of 2 separate claims that are linked. However following the usability tests of the first iteration of 60/40 designs a key insight was how users' mental model actually aligned with the other option; 60/40 claims were 1 claim in 2 parts. At the time we were not able to to iterate further due to delivery deadlines however following the election being called any launch dates were put on pause and we had an opportunity to iterate parts of this design to better align with users mental model.    

## What our ideas were
We first started playing around with some hacked together designs in figma, combinations of screenshots and figma components to get sense of concepts. The first concept we explored was combing two claim scaffold screens together using tabs 1 tab for the 60 claims and one for the 40 claim. Some of the keys challenges we identified we generating these ideas were:
- How to deal with the two different claim reference suffixes for a 60 and 40 parts.
- How to indicate when a 40 claim can be completed.
- How to clearly show the different statuses for the 60 and 40 parts. 
- How to relate CTAs to the relevant part that the user can submit.
- How to deal with claim data that is shared between claims such as learner or training.

Here are two screenshots from this first rapid ideation step:

  </figure>
  </div>
</div>

At this point we realised that the tabs were leading to the screens having a high cognitive load with too much information and too many competing design elements. We took a step to strip it back thinking more fundamentally about the 1 claim two parts move down the direction of splitting the existing 100 claim scaffold screen into two parts, effectively trying to stick as close to this mental model as possible. The particularly tricky challenge when exploring these concepts was how to relate the CTA's to the relevant part that the user can interact and submit. 

Here are two screenshots from this next rapid ideation step:

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 1rem;">
  <div style="flex: 1; max-width: 48%;">

  </div>
  <div style="flex: 1; max-width: 48%;">

We looked to try and resolve the issues around suffixes by removing them from the entire claims app, we felt this provided greater clarity for the user around the 60/40 claims without any loss of understanding elsewhere. However after technical discussions we reintroduced them back in, this was due to the reconciliation processes. As although we would be removing the suffixes for submitters the reconciliation process would need to still involve those suffixes as we wouldn;t be able to remove them from that aspect and there this might cause confusion for users. Given this would therefore impact understanding we reverted this idea and reintroduced the suffixes.

At this point we moved to prototyping to finesse some of the finer details of the design. We felt the final concept above was nearly there however there was two final aspect we wanted to resolve:
- The section at towards the top fo the design needed some refinement to better communicate the status of each part. 
- We needed to better group each part and show the logical step to the next part. 

After some further design thinking we came up with solutions to each fo these issues. For the first we condensed the content into two lines rather than any form of tabular view this greatly reduced the visual noise and as a result we felt it gave greater clarity to the content being communicated. For the second issue we opted to use elements from the step by step navigation elements.

We used the stepper component that runs vertically down the left side of this pattern to visually connect out 60 and 40 parts together. The final design we handed over was as follows:

## How we tested our ideas and what we found
Unfortunately due to being in the pre-election period we were not able to do any UR and given the expectation that we would likely be launching soon after the period was over we would have to test this during our private beta. 



## What we will do next
We will look to assess this design during private beta.
