## Why we did this work
At the end of May 2024 and the start of June 2024, we introduced a 60/40 funding model for eligible training (as described in the post "Designing for a different funding model - 60/40"). During this work, we had two conflicting mental models about how users might approach the 60/40 claim:

- **1 claim in 2 parts**
- **2 separate claims that are linked**

Due to time constraints, we initially opted for the simpler design of **2 separate claims that are linked**. However, following usability tests of the first iteration, we discovered that users' mental models actually aligned more with the idea of **1 claim in 2 parts**. With the election period putting our launch on hold, we were able to take advantage of the delay to revisit and refine this design to better match users' expectations.

## What our ideas were
We started by experimenting with some rough concepts in Figma, mixing screenshots and components to get a sense of the overall direction. The first concept explored was combining two claim scaffold screens using tabs—one for the 60% claim and one for the 40% claim. Key challenges we identified included:

- Managing the two different claim reference suffixes (for the 60% and 40% parts).
- Indicating when the 40% claim can be completed.
- Displaying the different statuses for the 60% and 40% parts.
- Ensuring CTAs (Call-to-Actions) aligned with the relevant claim part.
- Managing shared claim data (such as learner or training details) between the two claims.

Here are two screenshots from the first rapid ideation step:

  </div>
</div>

Upon further review, we found that using tabs introduced too much cognitive load, presenting too much information at once. To simplify, we explored the idea of splitting the existing 100% claim scaffold into two parts—aiming to align more closely with the **1 claim in 2 parts** model.

Here are two screenshots from this next rapid ideation step:

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 1rem;">
  <div style="flex: 1; max-width: 48%;">

We initially considered removing the claim suffixes (60 and 40) for clarity, but after technical discussions, we realized that the reconciliation process would still require the suffixes. Thus, we decided to reintroduce them to avoid confusion.

Next, we moved to prototyping and refined the finer details of the design. Two aspects remained unresolved:
- **Status Communication**: We needed to better convey the status of each part.
- **Part Grouping**: We needed a clearer visual connection between the 60% and 40% parts.

After some design iterations, we addressed these challenges:
- **Status Communication**: We condensed the status information into two lines, reducing visual clutter.
- **Part Grouping**: We used a step-by-step navigation pattern to visually link the two parts.

The final design, incorporating these improvements, was handed over as follows:

## How we tested our ideas and what we found
Unfortunately, due to the pre-election period, we were unable to conduct any user research (UR). Given that we expected to launch soon after the period, we plan to test the design during our private beta phase.

## What we will do next
We will assess this design during the private beta, gathering feedback and refining the design based on user input.
