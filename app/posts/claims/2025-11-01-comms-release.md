## Why we did this work
The project team did some work earlier this year to establish how new features on the service could best be communicated to both submitters and processors. 

In the end, the only part of this work that was carried forward for the release of the ability to view organisation details in the service (release 1.6, 20 March 2025) was an [internal Sharepoint newsletter](https://nhsbsauk.sharepoint.com/teams/SS-AdultSocialCare/SitePages/Example-New-Feature-Lands.aspx) to processors and CCS staff.

## What our ideas were

The next big release was for the addition of Oliver McGowan Mandatory Training (OMMT) to the service. This gave us an opportunity to revisit our approach to pre-release comms. 

### Internal comms (processor side)

For this release we again created an [internal Sharepoint newsletter](https://nhsbsauk.sharepoint.com/teams/SS-AdultSocialCare/SitePages/OMMT-release-newsletter.aspx?ct=1760371180622&or=OWA-NT-Mail&cid=e89efb19-78e7-313c-f6ea-e5015ff808a3&ga=1) for processors and CCS staff to communicate the OMMT release (1.10, 15 October 2025) and also the upcoming edit a claim feature. 

The newsletter included a video demonstrating the updates made to the service to accommodate OMMT.

UX also provided a live demo of the new OMMT features for BSA trainers and senior operations staff.

### External comms (submitter side)

We created an email and PDF to be sent to all active submitters to let them know that they could now claim for OMMT via the service. We also created an on-service banner linking to an OMMT information page.

The [email, PDF and banner](https://bsa2468.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ASCRS/pages/5478645773) were reviewed and signed off by BSA Operations, Comms and the stakeholder engagement manager. 

One issue was that, because the banner and accompanying page sat on the service, they had already been handed over for development. When a reviewer requested a late change to the on-service page this had to be raised with the development team. Luckily they were able to accommodate the request, even though it came a long time after handover.

One final task we needed to do was updating the [onboarding pack](https://nhsbsauk.sharepoint.com/teams/SS-AdultSocialCare/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fteams%2FSS%2DAdultSocialCare%2FShared%20Documents%2FASC%20Onboarding%2FOnboarding%20pack%2FASC%20onboarding%20pack%20%28V1%2E4%29%20%20%2Epdf&parent=%2Fteams%2FSS%2DAdultSocialCare%2FShared%20Documents%2FASC%20Onboarding%2FOnboarding%20pack) (V1.4) in order to alert new organisations onboarding to the service that they can use it to claim for OMMT. This was done in partnership with, and signed off by, BSA Operations and also the stakeholder engagement manager. 

### Edit a claim

A similar review process was used for the upcoming edit a claim release. This ran concurrently with the OMMT review. An [email and on-service banner](https://nhsbsauk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/SS-AdultSocialCare/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B542A67A4-6DEC-4307-9AAF-224091487013%7D&file=Edit%20a%20claim%20email%20to%20submitters%20and%20banner.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1%3Fweb%3D1) for submitters were reviewed and signed off by BSA Operations and Comms, and also BSA Policy (Operations had recommended that Policy should also provide sign off).

## How we tested our ideas and what we found
Following the release of OMMT, we held a [retro](https://bsa2468.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ASCRS/pages/5591728140) to work out:
- what went well with the release comms for OMMT
- any issues with the release comms
- what could be improved 

### Key insights and decisions

Following the retro we decided to:

#### Make sure release comms materials all sit in a single place

OMMT materials were split between Confluence and Sharepoint and this caused some confusion during review and sign off.
- All materials, including on-service content, should be stored on Sharepoint so that everyone has access to them, and they should be linked to from Confluence 
- Comms materials should sit on a single Word document so they can be reviewed easily

#### Make reviews of comms materials simpler
- Comms materials do not need to be reviewed by all operations managers, just one 
- We could potentially do content crits on calls, although getting people's time may be a challenge

#### Create a process map for release comms
Putting content creation, reviews and sign offs into workflow would make it easier to visualise what happens when, by whom and so on.

#### Establish more clarity on reviewing vs signing off
- We need to agree who has sign off vs people who want to have a look and make amends
- We also need to make it clear what sign off actually means for each reviewer, for example, ‘please ensure that this content aligns with BSA policy’ 

#### Establish with the tech team whether content changes can happen after handover

Comms materials will usually be created some time after designs for a new feature are handed over. This means that, for each release, we need to establish a deadline for any content amends needed to on-service content that has already been handed over.

## What we will do next
Following on from the comms review, we have already:
- created a [release comms process map on miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJ2oOVAs=/) (password: bsaasc123)
- created a [checklist](https://bsa2468.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ASCRS/pages/5623021569) for tracking each step in the release comms process
- met with tech and agreed that, prior to each release, we will stay in touch to understand the latest point at which on-service content can be amended – changes can be discussed on Monday bug triage call then UCD ticket created and, once actioned, go to BAs

The next release will be to allow submitters to add multiple learners to a claim. We will use the new process above and monitor how well it works for this major feature release.
