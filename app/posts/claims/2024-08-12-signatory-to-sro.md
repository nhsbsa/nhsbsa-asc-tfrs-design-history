## Why we did this work

During alpha, we had established the need for each organisation to sign the grant determination letter (GDL) before they could use the service.

This is a requirement of the Subsidy Control Act 2022 and outlines the conditions that an organisation must adhere to in order to receive reimbursement.

As the GDL requires a digital signature we started referring to the person who would provide this as the ‘signatory’.

We knew that the signatory would need to be the first person onboarded to the service, as no-one could submit a claim until they had signed the GDL. And that they would need to be someone with a suitable level of responsibility to be able to sign a legally-binding contract.

## What our ideas were

In testing prior to private beta starting, we had found that the term ‘signatory’ was not well understood by users. As a result, we had taken out references to signatories from the claims service. But it was still used by processors and had the potential to cause confusion during onboarding.

Luckily, the NHSBSA training team mentioned that other services referred to these primary users as ‘senior responsible officers’ (SROs) - a term that we really liked as it indicated both the seniority of the person required and also the fact that they would need to take legal responsibility for appropriate, non-fraudulent use of the service.

We therefore made a quick decision to change from ‘signatory’ to ‘senior responsible officer’ in the onboarding process. 

## How we tested our ideas and what we found

We did not have time to do any usability testing of this but we quickly gathered evidence as users started to be onboarded to the private beta service that the SRO terminology was much better understood and the previous confusion we’d seen disappeared.

## What we will do next

We’ll continue to test this during private beta and consider to what extent it might be useful to use the term within the service itself.
