## Recording design decisions in alpha
During alpha, we recorded design decisions in Confluence using a simple table format. This method helped us:
- Keep information organized.
- Capture hypotheses, measurements, outcomes, and next steps as new evidence emerged.

This approach allowed us to adapt quickly in a shifting landscape while maintaining a record of important decisions. Below is a screenshot of our design decision log:

## Challenges with the Confluence approach
While effective in some areas, this method had notable limitations:

**Pros**
- Straightforward to set up and maintain.
- Encouraged team-wide input without requiring technical expertise.

**Cons**
- Information wasn’t publicly accessible.
- The rigid table format limited flexibility.
- Navigation was challenging, especially for journey-specific decisions.
- Adapting the structure was difficult as the project evolved.

## Transition to the x-govuk design history tool
In alpha, we explored alternatives to improve how we captured design decisions. Inspired by the [DfE’s blog on design histories](https://dfedigital.blog.gov.uk/2020/09/01/design-history/), we adopted the x-govuk [design history tool](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-design-history/). This tool addressed many of the limitations we faced, including:

- Improved flexibility for posts and structure.
- Easier navigation and discovery of content.

### Addressing markdown knowledge
To mitigate barriers for team members unfamiliar with markdown:
- Those comfortable with markdown write posts directly.
- Others draft in plain text, which the team converts to markdown.

## Alignment with NHS BSA UCD logs
We follow NHS BSA's [UCD log recommendations](https://nhsbsa.github.io/nhsbsa-digital-playbook/design/interaction-designer/ucd-log/#resources), ensuring a consistent pattern for design history posts. This tool allows for flexibility when needed.

## Next steps
We will reevaluate the use of this tool further into beta. For a complete overview of our alpha work, visit our [Alpha Showcase site](https://asc-tfrs-showcase-6fc2dfe855a7.herokuapp.com/) (password: 'bsaasc123').
