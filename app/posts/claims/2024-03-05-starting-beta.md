Through Alpha we recorded design decisions in Confluence. We kept things simple and easy to use and captured information in a table.  When new evidence or assumptions were understood we created design hypotheses to test, how we would measure it and the outcomes of any testing with next steps if appropriate. Due to the shifting landscape this felt like a manageable approach for Alpha and allowed us to move forward at pace while also capturing important decisions and hypotheses as we went. Below is a screenshot of the confluence page:

When evaluating this method we a found few pros and cons:

Pros
- Simple
- Easy for anyone to contribute

Cons
- Not ‘in the open’
- Lacks flexibility due a naturally rigid table structure
- Difficult to navigate and find decisions related to specific journeys
- Difficult to adapt structure as project evolves

During Alpha we moved through 7 version of the prototype with very early concepts being more exploratory and as we progressed we converged on certain principles. The last version to be tested in Alpha was v6 and we finished Alpha with v7 of the prototype that address usability issues in version 6 as well as starting to tackle new parts of the service that will be needed for private beta go live. A version of this [original design decision log](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVN1iPGrY=/?share_link_id=574630710665) can be accessed with the password 'bsaasc123'.

Moving into Alpha we decided there was a need to iterate beyond this way of capturing design decisions and after coming across a [DfE blog](https://dfedigital.blog.gov.uk/2020/09/01/design-history/) regarding design histories we explored in more detail the option of using the X-GOVUK [design history tool](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-design-history/). After some discussion it was felt that utilising this tool would address some of the downsides our previous approach had. We did recognise, however, that the use of a tool such as this had limitations for who might be able to contribute. This issue was minimal as once the tool is setup there is only really the need to understand simple markdown to write posts and as we had a decent proportion of the design team that could write in simple markdown. For those that aren’t familiar we allow anyone to write a post in plain text that could be added quickly into markdown when needed by those who know how to do it. 

To keep us in line with NHS BSA recommended approach to [UCD logs](https://nhsbsa.github.io/nhsbsa-digital-playbook/design/interaction-designer/ucd-log/#resources). We will maintain a common pattern for design history posts but the nature of this tool allows for flexibility if needed depending on the nature of the post. 

We will reevaluate the use of this tool further into Beta. For a full overview of our Alpha for this service please view our [Alpha Showcase site](https://asc-tfrs-showcase-6fc2dfe855a7.herokuapp.com/), password 'bsaasc123'
