## Why we did this work

Currently in our service we have designed for claims that follow a funding model requiring claims to be submitted after completion of the course for which the the organisation would receive 100% of the calculated reimbursement amount back. However we have always been aware that another model that was in the backlog that involve the user submitted evidence of payment, after the course has started for 60% of the calculated reimbursement amount and then submitting evidence of completion following the completion of the training for the remaining 40%. We had previously held an MVP mindset and just focussed on the 100% funding model but we now had to deliver designs to allow for this 60/40 funding model.

At this stage we were under immense time pressure due to tight delivery deadlines for a June launch so the approach was to try and remain within the bounds of existing design work as much as possible and reuse elements. 

## What our ideas were
Previously we had done some design thinking to identify two possible mental models for the 60/40 claims. 
- 1 claim in 2 parts
- 2 separate claims that are linked

It was felt that exploring the second of these would be most pragmatic to start with as it was simpler to tackle from a design perspective and meant we could reuse more of the existing claim scaffold screen design. This would mean a quicker design phase for this work. However we felt that both could be equally as likely and with the limited time and opportunity to react to user insights following any testing there would be a risk either way we went and we didn't have time to design and explore two concepts with users.

Firstly we established what a 60 claim and 40 claim look like in the claim scaffold screen. This was fairly straight forward due to the structure of that screen. The 60 claim was the same just a 100 claim without the evidence of completion section and the 40 claim was just without the evidence of payment and the evidence of completion was the only editable section.

After this we had several key design challenges to tackle in the overall journey:
- how does a 60 claim start
- how and when does the 40 claim start
- how do we link the two claims together

We could identify whether training was eligible for the 60/40 funding model at the point when they select the training at the start of a new claim, so this seemed the logical place to route them towards a 60 claim rather than a 100 claim. However what we had learned in some early exploratory research on this topic was that not all organisations would want to make use of the 60/40 funding model and in fact some would rather wait till the training was complete and then submit a claim for the 100%. Therefore we decided to make the use of the 60/40 funding model optional. We did this by asking them a question after they selected a training that was eligible for the 60/40 funding model. The question gave them the chance to opt into using the 60/40 funding model rather than making it compulsory.

Next was the challenge of when does the 40 claim start, there were some constraints here:
- A 40 claim can't be submitted if a 60 claim is rejected.
- A 60 claim has to be processed before a 40 claim, as 60 part determines the reimbursement amounts for both claims

These direct us down two routes:
- The user can create and submit the 40 claim after the 60 claim is approved
- A user can create the 40 claim straight after the 60 claim but can't submit it until the 60 claim is approved

We opted for the former here as we believed that users would want to start the 40 claim once the learner had completed the course. Given that the minimum duration of courses is 2 months we believed that it is likely that the 60 claim would have be submitted and processed by the time the learner has completed the training and the 40 claim is ready to be created. Therefore our proposed process would involve the option to start the 40 claim once the 60 claims has been approved. Our starting point was to put this interaction on the 60 claim screen when it is in the approved state.

![A screenshot taken of the interaction to start a 40 claim on an approved 60 claim in version 9 of the prototype](start-40.png "Start the 40 claim from an approved 60 claim")

 However we did anticipate some potential issues this design might have:
- Users may not know to go the 60 claim to start the 40 claim when the time comes. 
- Users may attempt to start a new claim when they come to make the 40 claim

While not ideal these should be caught by our error handling preventing users from creating duplicate claims. This does mean however we have one issue that we are unable to resolve, if a 40 claim is rejected the submitter has no way of resubmitting it like they do for 100 and 60 claims. This will be an issue particularly for simple mistakes like they accidentally uploaded the wrong evidence. This issue was accepted and we would look resolve this when we are able to look at the 'queired' state in the backlog, which is the concept of allowing a dialogue between processors and submitters to allow claims to be corrected and resubmitted.

The final challenge we identified was how to link to the 60 claim to the 40 claim, the approach we took was to provide a link to the other claim (if it has one) in the summary information at the top of the claim scaffold screen.

## How we tested our ideas and what we found
We ran usability testing with 5 users on these designs w/c 13th June, we had the following goals:
- To identify the information required for users to understand and complete a 60-40 claim
- To test the user journey from starting a new claim to submitting the 40% claim
- To understand how and when users would choose a 60-40 claim over a 100% claim
- To understand how users might track and identify the second claim when creating a 60/40 claim

Some of the key findings were as follows:
- In general, users understood the 60/40 model as receiving 60% of training costs when the training was paid for, and receiving 40% of training costs when the course was completed
- Users were keen to use a 60/40 split model for the following reasons:
  - To receive funding for cash flow reasons (especially for more expensive courses, such as a £300 payment compared to a £65 course)
  - To minimize the risk of receiving no funding if the course was not completed
  - To minimize the risk of an employee leaving without competing the course
- Users suggested they'd use the 100% model:
  - To minimize administrative burdens, especially when courses were (relatively) cheap and/or short
  - Because they'd prefer to claim once and wait, rather than have to complete two separate components
- However there was some confusion about the risk involved in using 60/40 split compared to claiming 100% at the end of the completed course. For example, one user stated that they would prefer to use the 100% unless they were sure that someone would complete the training. This may suggest that they think the 60% must be repaid if the course is not completed. It would be worth testing this with future UR sessions.
- The "claim status" labels were also not clear - some thought that only 100% complete claims could be approved, for example
- All users felt that the split model was one claim, in two parts. There was some minor confusion about whether a 100 claim was the final status of a 60 and a 40 claim, emphasizing that people see the model as one claim in two parts

## What we will do next
We were at a challenging point following insights from usability testing. Despite finding issues particularly that users did in fact think of 60/40 claims as one claim in two parts we didn't have the time to do any major iteration to the design. We decided to address as many of the issues as we could with content updates and minor interaction tweaks. Among the changes were improved explanations for the reimbursement amount, added new explanations for the claim types and added additional content towards the top of the 60 and 40 claim scaffold screens. These changes can be seen in v10 of the prototype.

However none of this would resolve the issue of users thinking of 60/40 claims as one claim in two parts not as two separate claims. Unfortunately due to delivery deadlines the decision was taken ata a delivery and product level not to iterate this design further and we would look to monitor the existing design in early private beta with the aim of returning to iterate the design in the future.
