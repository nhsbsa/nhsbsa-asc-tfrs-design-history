## Why we did this work

Our service previously focused on a 100% funding model, where claims were submitted after course completion. However, we needed to adapt the design to support a new 60/40 funding model. This model requires users to submit evidence of payment for 60% of the reimbursement amount after the course begins and then submit evidence of completion for the remaining 40%. 

Although we initially focused on the 100% funding model, we had always known that the 60/40 funding model would be necessary. Given tight deadlines for the June launch, our goal was to remain within the bounds of existing designs and reuse components wherever possible.

## What our ideas were

### Exploring two potential mental models for 60/40 claims

We identified two potential mental models for 60/40 claims:
- **One claim in two parts**: A single claim split into two stagesâ€”60% paid after payment evidence, and 40% after completion evidence.
- **Two linked claims**: Two separate claims, one for the 60% reimbursement and one for the 40%, that are linked together.

We decided to explore the second option, as it was simpler and would allow us to reuse the existing claim scaffold screen design, thus speeding up the design process. 

### Adapting the claim scaffold screen

For the **60% claim**, the design remained similar to the 100% claim, with the only difference being the removal of the evidence of completion section. The **40% claim** was structured similarly, but without the evidence of payment section. 

#### Key design challenges:
1. **How does a 60% claim start?**
2. **How and when does the 40% claim start?**
3. **How do we link the two claims together?**

We established that users should be able to choose the 60/40 funding model when they select eligible training for a new claim. However, we learned from early research that not all organizations would opt for the 60/40 model, and some might prefer to wait until training is complete to submit a 100% claim. Therefore, we made the 60/40 funding model optional, prompting users with a choice after selecting eligible training.

### Starting the 40% claim

Given that the 60% claim must be processed before the 40% claim, we decided that users could create the 40% claim after the 60% claim is approved. This interaction would be placed on the 60% claim screen when it is in the approved state.

### Linking claims together

To link the 60% claim with the 40% claim, we added a link to the other claim in the summary section at the top of the claim scaffold screen.

## How we tested our ideas and what we found

We tested these designs with 5 users during the week of 13th June, aiming to achieve the following objectives:
- Identify the information users need to understand and complete a 60/40 claim.
- Test the user journey from starting a new claim to submitting the 40% claim.
- Understand how users would decide between the 60/40 model and the 100% model.
- Learn how users would track and identify the second claim when creating a 60/40 claim.

Key findings included:
- **Understanding of 60/40 model**: Users understood that the 60% was for training payment and the 40% for completion. 
- **Reasons for choosing 60/40**: Users preferred the 60/40 model to manage cash flow and reduce risks associated with incomplete courses.
- **Preference for 100% model**: Some users chose the 100% model for its simplicity, particularly for short or low-cost courses.
- **Confusion around claim status**: Some users mistakenly thought only 100% claims could be approved.
- **Claim perception**: All users thought the 60/40 claims were a single claim in two parts, not two separate claims.

## What we will do next

Although usability testing revealed valuable insights, we didn't have time to implement major iterations to the design before launch. We made minor content updates, improved explanations of the reimbursement amount, and added clearer labeling on the 60 and 40 claim scaffold screens.

Despite these adjustments, we acknowledged that the perception of 60/40 claims as one claim in two parts would remain an issue. We plan to monitor the design during the private beta phase and prioritize iterating the design based on user feedback in future releases.
