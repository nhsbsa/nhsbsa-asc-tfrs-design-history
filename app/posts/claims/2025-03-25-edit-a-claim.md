## Why we did this work

More context provided on this work in claim side. 

## What our ideas were

### Claims table

- New status of queried claims

### Claim edits

- update everything including training, 
- have to keep to same claim type, can't change integral structure of claim
- shows updated tag if something is different from resubmitted claim 

### Claim history 

- view query note
- view previous submissions
- the latest query note is in the main part of view
- if its a not yet processed claim show the view claim for latest submission also so they can compare between what was submitted and what might have been edited in the view, otherwise hide button to view latest submission as that is what is displayed in main page 
- Show name of who did the action 

### Save for later

- Keeps changes and the claim stays in queried state
- Resubmit details moves to the claim submitted and its in the history that would reflect this is a resubmitted claim to the submitter
