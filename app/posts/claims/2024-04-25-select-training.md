## Why we did this work

We had been given an agreed eligible training list for the care skills funding pot for the start of private beta. To date we had made some assumptions and created a general structure for what we felt this data would contain. Now we had this new training list we needed to adapt how the training list is displayed in the select training screen to accommodate the new data structure. 

Alongside this when we removed the training details screen from the MVP designs we are potentially now missing key information to identify the right training so we needed to review what data we are presenting on the screen as well to ensure we have the right information needed to help users identify the right training. 

Finally we know that we will need to accommodate different funding models in the future. We need to consider changes to the journey that might better accommodate these funding models in the future.
