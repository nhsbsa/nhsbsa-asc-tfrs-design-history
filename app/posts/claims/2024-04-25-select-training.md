## Why we did this work

We had been given an agreed eligible training list for the care skills funding pot for the start of private beta. To date we had made some assumptions and created a general structure for what we felt this data would contain. Now we had this new training list we needed to adapt how the training list is displayed in the select training screen to accommodate the new data structure. 

Alongside this when we removed the training details screen from the MVP designs we are potentially now missing key information to identify the right training so we needed to review what data we are presenting on the screen as well to ensure we have the right information needed to help users identify the right training. 

Finally we know that we will need to accommodate different funding models in the future. We need to consider changes to the journey that might better accommodate these funding models in the future.

## What our ideas were




## How we tested our ideas and what we found
Unfortunately we were not able to test this with users before development work progressed but we did get the opportunity to test these with users w/c 6 May 2024. What we found is users understood how we communicated around the 1 April 2024 policy date and they didn't feel that supplying completion date would be any issue as this information comes hand in hand with the certification. However we didn't feel that the findings on the policy date were completely concrete due to the nature of usability testing. 

## What we will do next
We will monitor this closely through private beta and particularly look at feedback and analytics around the impact of the 1 April 2024 policy date and whether users still try to make claims for training paid for or started before this date. We believe that as the time progresses the risk of users trying to make claims for training started or paid for before this date will reduce.
