## Why we did this work

We suspected for a while that some new users of the service had unrealistic expectations of what they could get reimbursement for and how the claims process worked. We thought this was particularly likely for people who'd used the Workforce Development Fund (WDF) previously. This is the legacy reimbursement scheme that LDSS is replacing.

What we noticed during onboarding calls was that many SROs had used the WDF and expected the new service to be very similar. But in fact our service has important differences, particularly around evidence requirements.

The UR carried out during sprint 19 provided strong evidence to back this up.

All participants compared the LDSS to their previous experience with WDF as a benchmark (unprompted) and thought LDSS was a 'new and improved version'. Even those who had read the scheme guidance (which not everyone had) did not realise the important differences between WDF and LDSS.

## What our ideas were

Our hypothesis was that helping users understand the differences and benefits of LDSS over the WDF would support higher quality claims and less user frustration, which could lead to a higher volume of approved claims.

Working with DHSC, we created a simple comparison of the WDF and LDSS. This covered:

* What can be claimed​
* How to claim​
* Evidence required​
* Payment model​
* Amount of funding​
* How to register​
* Prerequisites​
* Cut-off for claims

## How we tested our ideas and what we found

We are waiting for DHSC to sign off this new content. We'll then add it to the onboarding pack, test with users and review the impact on the claim rejection rate.

## What we will do next

We will continue to explore ideas for helping users to understand LDSS and supporting them to submit claims that can be approved.
