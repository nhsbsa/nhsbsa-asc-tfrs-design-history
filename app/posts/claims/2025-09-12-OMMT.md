## Why we did this work
Oliver McGowan Mandatory Training (OMMT) focuses on upskilling in Learning Disabilities and Autism and is the government’s recommended package for health and social care staff to meet the training requirement on learning disability and autism under the Health and Care Act 2022. Funding has been made available to the sector to help pay for this required training and the current LDSS service has been identified as the method through which that funding can be delivered to the sector. 

Due to timescales tied to ministerial announcements there was pressure to identify the minimal amount of work needed to allow OMMT to be reimbursed in the service. Tha approach taken was to conduct technical and design spikes to identify the changes needed and highlight risks with the speed of approach as we would be unable to test solutions with users.

OMMT comes in two tiers and unlike other LDSS courses there are two different reimbursement rates depending on the method of delivery:
- internally delivered training
- externally procured training

Any solution would need to allow of these different methods of delivery. In addition internally delivered training does not require evidence of payment and has a fixed reimbursement rate. 

## What our ideas were

We identified a number of changes to explore for OMMT, given we weren't testing we had to balence the changes we wanted to make with the risk of not testing them and not communicating the information at all.

### Before you start
Although currently not a core screen in our end to end journey the before the you start page provides users with key information about the service including eligibility and what they need to be able to make a claim. As we are in private beta and use of the service is invite only users are usually directed straight to the login journey and the information on this screen is provided through the onboarding pack. 

The identfied changes were to add content to communicate that OMMT can now be claimed through the service. This was a simple line reading:

This would also link to the new in service gudiance page.

### Select training
The quickest way we could add OMMT into the service was to treat it as any other course in our eligible training list. This would work well mechanically, as we already have an agreed process for the introduction of new training to our training list. However there was a slight challenge with this due to the different rimbursement rates for:
- internally delivered training
- externally procured training

We identified that there may be a risk in users misidentifying what training delivery method they have utilised. We explored some different ideas in how to tackle this: 
1. Having a single entry for tier 1 and tier 2 OMMT and asking a following yes/no question where we could help guide them in decision making. 
2. We have two seperate entries in the training list for each tier repesenting each delivery method and have additional guidance in the select training page. 

There were pros and cons of both these options. While 1. may reduce the risk of mistakes once users understand the different delivery methods this page would likely be seen as adding time onto a process that will already be frustrating without the multiple learners per claim feature particuklarly given the volume of OMMT claims expected. Option 2. would be simpler to deliver however adds an added layer to how users select training that would mean OMMT is treated slightly differently in the list. 

We decided to go with option 2 and added a small bit of content that would then link to the new in-service guidance page.

### New in-service guidance
Given the differences between OMMT and other LDSS courses particularly the different delivery methods and evidence requirements we felt that have specific guidance in the service for OMMT was needed and as described above we would link to this guidance where appropriate to support users in their journey. We also had to make a small change to the reimbursement rate guidance page to changes introduced for internally delivered training.

### Internally delivered OMMT claims
For internally delivered OMMT claims the submitter does not provide evidence of payment and payment date. This was simple to accomodate in the designs due to the existing design of the claim page. The change required involed removing evidence of payment and payment dates inputs from the claim screen when the user has selected internally delivered OMMT.

### Decleration and CQC checking
To claim for OMMT an organisation must be CQC registered, due to time and data limitations we would not be able to implement changes in the service that would prevent any organisations who isn't CQC registered from claiming. This would be checked by processors during claim processing, it was recomended that a process is put in place to minimise the duplication of checks as it is expected that organisation with submit large quantities of OMMT claims and we would want to avoid this CQC check being carried out for each claim from the same organisation. 

We also explored whether changes would be needed to the decleration made by submitters before the submit however it was agreed that changes would be made to the GDL and therefore the existing content in the service was suitable. 

### Training provider selection
OMMT training must be delivered by eligible training providers from an approved list from NHSE. To reduce the strain on processors checking this NHSE list we explored ways we could allow users to select the training provider from a list in the service. This would mean the processors only need to ensure the evidence matches what has been selected in the claim.

However a number of challenges were found in pursuing this for the release. Time to delivered and the lack of change control process around the list due to it being managed by NHSE. It was therefore decided not to progress with any changes to existing process. 

## What we will do next

As mentioned due to tight delivery timescales we weren't able to test designs with users. Through the design spike we identified that many of the changes were low risk without testing. We still had some concerns however:
1. Users may select the wrong delivery method
2. Users may not have the appropriate evidence of completion as that is not provided by default by training providers
3. Without multiple learners per claim users may not see it worth while time claiming due to the low reimbursement rates and time to claim for each individual learner.

Our analysis showed that 1. is mitigated by edit a claim allowing them to correct mistakes rather than creating a new claim however the absence of multiple learner per claim still makes this potentially a major pain point for users. There was little we can about 2. and 3. beyond what we had already implemented in the time available. It was agreed that we would closely monitor all these following release and multiple learners is the next major feature priority as well.
