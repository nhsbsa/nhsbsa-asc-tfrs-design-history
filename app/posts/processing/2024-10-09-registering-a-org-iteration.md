Three journey flows developed (id's in brackets below to test in prototype)
- new org (type in "G03944234"), add a signatory and invite them and org. 
- a invited not registered signatory (type in "resend or B02944934"), can send a new invite or edit details to send new
- registered signatory (type in "dupe or D18946931"), which just displays information


## Why we did this work

Deactivation - removed, as questions over what comes next in workshop
Adding edit, following flow trying to move person forward
Backs and cancels

Post workshop 24th October a few updates agreed:
- deactivate feature of a registered signatory for a organisation is not to be included in work. Instead it is to be researched on what is the process for resolving this currently offline. 
- a invited signatory can have both name and email updated which will involve a new invite to be sent for these details to be updated

## What we did
