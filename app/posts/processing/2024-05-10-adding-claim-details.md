On feedback from research that happened w/c 15 May 2024 we iterated the design. Before we could test these updates though we had a product owner decision that needed to scale even further back to meet delivery deadlines. That’s why this is V2, next updates in V3.

## Why we did this work
What claim information does the processor need to process a claim?

- [if applicable] Sprint goal and some background for the sprint
- [if applicable] Sprint numbers is spanning over multiple sprints
- Provide key findings of the research and discovery work
- Timelines are an effective way to present the journey the work has taken from initial research to the design
- Insight into your design decisions

Research dates: []

In our initial ideation session we had the assumption that no additional information is needed by the processor when they land into the claim, just the claim status and the claim ID the processor typed in. The processor's task will be to judge the evidence by the criteria and information we give per question and they have no other purpose for more information on this claim details view.

Insights from the research showed us users felt they wanted to see more details about the claim to help orientate themselves on what the submitters has submitted and thought it was odd to not see anything else on this screen. 

This work is iterating on what details to include and the layout of presenting this information. 

## What our ideas were
- Providing visuals of Information architecture
- Including all interactions
- Wireframe and interface ideation
- Hypothesis

>**We believe that** the submitter’s name and email
>**Will be needed by** processors
>**As it will** get in contact with the submitter to query something, advise on something not right in the claim etc.

- Decided not the processor’s job to spot fraud as that’s more high level above one claim. The job here is to process a single claim. 
- Research needed to understand whether the claims details presented help orientate users on what the claim is for and by whom. 
- move notes to make layout work

## How we tested our ideas and what we found

- Prototype URLs and version numbers must be provided as part of the UCD log
- User testing feedback
- URLs to Miro boards and prototypes where any iteration history is documented

- This 

## What we will do next
- For closing comments on the UCD log, give some information on what the next steps are with this piece of work, are there any further iterations that could be made but may not be as high priority just yet, is there further research to be done on a certain part of the design. Talk about things you were not able to do as part of this design that you want to be raised at a later stage and how this has been documented to be revisited.

## What claim information does the processor need to process a claim?

#### Iteration on design:
Adding organisation and claim details

- From round of user research users wanted to see more information on a claim to orientate themselves within it. The inclusion of information like the submitter’s name and email would be useful if the processor wanted to get in contact with the submitter to query something, advise on something not right in the claim etc. 
- Decided not the processor’s job to spot fraud as that’s more high level above one claim. The job here is to process a single claim. 
- Research needed to understand whether the claims details presented help orientate users on what the claim is for and by whom.
