On feedback from research that happened w/c 15 May 2024 we iterated on our initial MVP designs. Before we could test these updates though we had a product owner decision that decided to scale even further back to meet tight delivery deadlines. These iterated claim details designs are in V2, the next stripped back updates are in V3.

## Why we did this work

Research dates: []

In our initial ideation session we had the assumption that no additional information is needed by the processor when they land into the claim, just the claim status and the claim ID the processor typed in. The processor's task will be to judge the evidence by the criteria and information we give per question and they have no other purpose for more information on this claim details view.

Insights from the research showed us users felt they wanted to see more details about the claim to help orientate themselves on what the submitters has submitted and thought it was odd to not see anything else on this screen. 

This work is iterating on what details to include and the layout of presenting this information. 

## What our ideas were

Key question: What claim information does the processor need to process a claim?

- From round of user research users wanted to see more information on a claim to orientate themselves within it. The inclusion of information like the submitter’s name and email would be useful if the processor wanted to get in contact with the submitter to query something, advise on something not right in the claim etc. 
- We decided it was not the processor’s job to spot fraud when processing a claim as that’s more high level above one claim. The job here is to process a single claim. 
- We tried various layouts to make the notes functionality all fit on one screen.


## What we will do next
- Research needed to understand whether the claims details presented help orientate users on what the claim is for and by whom.
- This iteration is untested due to business decisions made to strip out more functionality to meet tight deadlines. This design work is implemented in Version 2, with stripped back work in Version 3.
