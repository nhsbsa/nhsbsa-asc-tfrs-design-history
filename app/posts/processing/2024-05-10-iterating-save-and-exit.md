On feedback from research that happened w/c 15 May 2024 we iterated the design. Before we could test these updates though we had a product owner decision that needed to scale even further back to meet delivery deadlines. Thatâ€™s why this is V2, next updates in V3.





## Save and exit

#### Assumption: 
- Would be wanted to know processing was complete success

#### Finding:
- confirmation screen was of limited use and processors were keen to check that the caim status has been updated 

#### Iteration on design:
Hypothesising processor might begin processing then as multiple tasks to complete and costs to work out they might go away and come back, annoying to have to start again. Button the save and exit needed. 

#### Screenshots:

---------

- register an org will not be tested with users before release due to time pressures and low risks given this nature of the process
