For care skills funding there are two funding types: 100, and 60/40. So far the designs allow for 100 claims to be processed, but for MVP both 100 and 60 claims are expected to be delivered. There are differences between the information that is supplied by the submitter for these two types of claims so the designs need to be changed and considered to allow for them to be processed. The 40 part of the 60/40 claim is not expected to have any claims submitted for for quite some time so some scope that they may not need to be included for MVP, but because so closely linked with 60, still need to be considered during the design process to allow for a holistic journey and reduce amount of work needing to be done in the future.


So far we have only included 100 claims designs in the prototype. We have considered the 60/40 TU claim offering along the way considering whether our current designs would have the flexibility to 

## Why we did this work

One of our biggest questions for a 60 claim is whether the 60 / 40 parts of the claim are two seperate claims to be processed seperately or two parts of the same claim. This is something that is being considered in the submitter journey alongside on how we present.

Allowing for 60 updates
- Reimbursement amount, importance of content

This is the information the submitter has supplied and needs to be presented to the processor to process their claim correctly.
This is the current view of the 100 claim processor journey.


## What our ideas were

>**We believe that** the 60 and 40 are part of the same 
>**Will be needed for** processors to find the correct claim
>**As it will** allow them to search in our service and find their claim.


- Providing visuals of Information architecture
- Including all interactions
- Wireframe and interface ideation
- Hypothesis

## How we tested our ideas and what we found

- Prototype URLs and version numbers must be provided as part of the UCD log
- User testing feedback
- URLs to Miro boards and prototypes where any iteration history is documented

## What we will do next
- For closing comments on the UCD log, give some information on what the next steps are with this piece of work, are there any further iterations that could be made but may not be as high priority just yet, is there further research to be done on a certain part of the design. Talk about things you were not able to do as part of this design that you want to be raised at a later stage and how this has been documented to be revisited.
