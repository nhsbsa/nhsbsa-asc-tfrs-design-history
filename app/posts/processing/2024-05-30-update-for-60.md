We had a processing workstream kickoff on ... with the wider product team to begin the processing a claim piece of work. After understanding the constraints and the scope of the journey from multiple buisness and tech perspectives, we had a in-person workshop with the UCD team. We explored ideas of how this journey could look, what are the needs and wants of the users and then stripped it back to the MVP of what we deemed necessary to complete a processing claim journey based off assumptions and hypothesis'. We tested this inital design flow w/c 22 April 2024.




Allowing for 60 updates
- Reimbursement amount, importance of content 


So far we have only included 100 claims designs in the prototype. Next up is 60 part of 60/40 TU claims. Can't think about 60 without 40 

So far we have only included 100 claims designs in the prototype. We have considered the 60/40 TU claim offering along the way considering whether our current designs would have the flexibility to 

## Why we did this work

One of our biggest assumptions for a 60 claim is whether the 60 / 40 parts of the claim are two seperate claims or two parts of the same claim.

## What our ideas were
- Providing visuals of Information architecture
- Including all interactions
- Wireframe and interface ideation
- Hypothesis

## How we tested our ideas and what we found

- Prototype URLs and version numbers must be provided as part of the UCD log
- User testing feedback
- URLs to Miro boards and prototypes where any iteration history is documented

## What we will do next
- For closing comments on the UCD log, give some information on what the next steps are with this piece of work, are there any further iterations that could be made but may not be as high priority just yet, is there further research to be done on a certain part of the design. Talk about things you were not able to do as part of this design that you want to be raised at a later stage and how this has been documented to be revisited.
