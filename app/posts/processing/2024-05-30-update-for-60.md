## Why we did this work

For care skills funding there are two funding types: 100, and 60/40. So far the prototype and designs allow for 100 claims to be processed, but for MVP both 100 and 60 claims are expected to be delivered. There are differences between the information that is supplied by the submitter for these two types of claims so the designs need to be changed and considered to allow for them both to be processed. The 40 part of the 60/40 claim is not expected to have any claims submitted for for quite some time so some scope that they may not need to be included for MVP, but because so closely linked with 60, still need to be considered during the design process to allow for a holistic journey and reduce amount of work needing to be done in the future.

## What our ideas were

One of our biggest questions for a 60/40 claim is whether the 60 / 40 parts of the claim are two seperate claims to be processed seperately or two parts of the same claim. This is something that is also being considered in the submitter journey alongside, on how we present. The two parts of a 60/40 claim will still be submitted at different moments of time and the 40 will only be processed if the 60 part is approved, so to fit into the current flow of a 100 claim, it fits that can judge each part in isolation.

>**We believe that** splitting and judging 60 and 40 parts of a claim in isolation
>**Will be needed for** processors
>**As they will** only need the information relevant to each part of the claim at that moment to process.

>**We believe that** following the layout of a 100 claim for a 60 claim
>**Will be needed for** processors
>**As it will** follow the layout they are already used to from processing 100 claims, and has much of the same or similar information that can adapt to work for both.

We believe that problem areas with 60/40 claims going into the condensed MVP single screen is the calculation of the reimbursement amount, as this is already an area identified as confusing for processors with room for error. 

>**We believe that** well considered content
>**Will be needed for** processors
>**As it will** allow them to understand how it is calculated and what is needed of them to ensure the correct amount is reimbursed.

>**We believe that** automatically calculating the reimbursement amount
>**Will be needed for** processors
>**As it will** reduce the mental load, and once we have the cost per learner from the processor.

>**We believe that** needing the processors to enter the cost per learner rather than asking the submitters
>**Will be needed for** submitters
>**As it will** reduce the burden on the submitters on what they have to submit, and we can train processors to ensure more accurate calculations.

>**As it will** provide space for content on reimbursment amount explanations and what is going to happen next.

## How we tested our ideas and what we found

- From testing we found processors found calculating the cost per learner difficult when presented with a variety of evidence, that sometimes stated costs for multiple learners, so they would have to work out how much from one. 

## What we will do next
- Refinement of content adding examples of reimbursement calculations.
- To be reflected in the future, post MVP, the iteration on this processing screen with the aim to reduce the cognitive load on the processor and refine how we ask them to check criteria.
