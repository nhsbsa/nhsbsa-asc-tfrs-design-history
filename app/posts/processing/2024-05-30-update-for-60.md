We had a processing workstream kickoff on ... with the wider product team to begin the processing a claim piece of work. After understanding the constraints and the scope of the journey from multiple buisness and tech perspectives, we had a in-person workshop with the UCD team. We explored ideas of how this journey could look, what are the needs and wants of the users and then stripped it back to the MVP of what we deemed necessary to complete a processing claim journey based off assumptions and hypothesis'. We tested this inital design flow w/c 22 April 2024.
