We had a processing workstream kickoff on ... with the wider product team to begin the processing a claim piece of work. After understanding the constraints and the scope of the journey from multiple buisness and tech perspectives, we had a in-person workshop with the UCD team. We explored ideas of how this journey could look, what are the needs and wants of the users and then stripped it back to the MVP of what we deemed necessary to complete a processing claim journey based off assumptions and hypothesis'. We tested this inital design flow w/c 22 April 2024.

## Why we did this work

- [if applicable] Sprint goal and some background for the sprint
- [if applicable] Sprint numbers is spanning over multiple sprints
- Provide key findings of the research and discovery work
- Timelines are an effective way to present the journey the work has taken from initial research to the design
- Insight into your design decisions

>**How might we** give users all the functionality they need to process a claim.

## What our ideas were

#### What claim detail information does the processor need to see when they land on a claim?

Our starting assumption for this question is that the purpose of a processor is strictly to judge evidence of payment and completion against some criteria stating its the correct training etc so the processor will only need to know any claim information during the questioning and they have no other purpose for more information on this claim details view. 

>**We believe that** only the claim status and the claim ID 
>**Will be useful information for** processors to process a claim
>**As it will** allow them to know they are in the claim they expect from the claim ID and there is no additional information neccessary to complete a claim.

To be tested
- Whether users have any other purpose and needs for any additional information about the claim beyond information provided in criteria checks.

#### How can a processor effectively view the multiple pieces of evidence?

We started out looking into how other services present new evidence and investigating technical constraints of showing in the view. We believed that opening in seperate tabs poses issues for the user with confusion over having multiple tabs open and losing track which is which piece of evidence. We looked into other services and it was a common pattern however to open in new tabs so we decided this is something to investigate in research.

>**We believe that** opening the evidence in new tabs
>**Will be useful information for** processors
>**As it will** allow them to view the evidence of payment and evidence of completion to complete their criteria checks.


To be tested
- Whether opening files in new tabs will pose usability issues and add confusion of which evidence has been viewed.

#### What notes are useful for the processor to write/read back in the future?

We started off with the assumption 
A feature hypothesised to be very valuable to users, so they can leave context for future viewing on a claim, to log escalations, to add rejection notes. 
Deciding on categories, had many options. Hypothesising on the reasons notes might be added

>**We believe that** adding the feature of notes
>**Will be useful information for** processors
>**As it will** allow them to 

To be tested
- What would a processor need notes for?

#### How can the processor check the evidence against the criteria?

We started out with the question of multiple criteria per piece of evidence or multiple evidence per one piece of criteria. We decided one question for all the evidence. We earlier decided they only needed the claim details at this time, can incorportate into question to make easier. 
- Hypothesis of need a rejection input box to capture each no’s rejection reason. This will generate a rejection note that will be added to notes. 

>**We believe that** one question per page with all the evidence available and information about the claim incorporated into the question
>**Will be useful information for** processors
>**As it will** allow them to reduce cognitive load, making it easy for them to know what they need to compare and focus on each question at a time. 

To be tested
- Research to understand how best to capture notes when criteria aren't met. 
- Research to understand whether criteria checking with one question per page is usable

#### How will the processor judge that a claim is approved or rejected?

Hypothesis
Flow of predetermined outcome.
That asking single criteria questions per page, need a check your answers to see all at once. And the outcome view is dynamically approved or rejected based off the radio selections. 

To be tested
- Research to understand how users perceive prescriptive criteria checks that lead to a predetermined outcome

#### Cost per learner

Hypothesis
Hypothesised that this is going to be a very tricky part of the journey, very prone to errors, big risk as could end up entering more money than should and bsa will be paying out more than meant to. First stab at content, thinking need this on a separate page to focus the content to help the processor work it out. 

To be tested
- Research to understand how to help users identify cost paid by organisation.

#### Rejection notes

Hypothesis
- Hypothesis of need a rejection input box to capture each no’s rejection reason. This will generate a rejection note that will be added to notes. 

To be tested
- Is this helpful

## How we tested our ideas and what we found

- Prototype URLs and version numbers must be provided as part of the UCD log
- User testing feedback
- URLs to Miro boards and prototypes where any iteration history is documented

## What we will do next
- For closing comments on the UCD log, give some information on what the next steps are with this piece of work, are there any further iterations that could be made but may not be as high priority just yet, is there further research to be done on a certain part of the design. Talk about things you were not able to do as part of this design that you want to be raised at a later stage and how this has been documented to be revisited.
