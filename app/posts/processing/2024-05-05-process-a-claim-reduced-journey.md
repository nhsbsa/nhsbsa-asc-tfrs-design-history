With an aggressive delivery deadline fast approaching and tight time to technically deliver, the decision was made by â€¦ to simplify the processing a claims journey as much as possible to have the things the users need to execute but less less effort by tech. 

In a workshop attended by the entire product team a series of key decisions were made to cut out or scale back certain features for this journey. These product decisions were all logged in our project decision log held in Mira along with any associated risks and mitigations. The extended journey is in V2 of the prototype, this version was untested with users before these decisions were made so changes were made in V3 of the prototype. V3 has been tested with 4 users in the week commencing 15 May 2024. Research aimed to understand the impact of MVP changes


## Remove claim notes

Notes are decided not to be necessary to the core user journey to process a claim, something to be revisited.

## Remove multiple views, condense into 2

Multiple screens becomes more technical effort. Condensing. Going to see how this tests in user research, as to whether we iterate on this journey or go back to previous. combined critiera question onto claim details screen for MVP, removed seperate screen for capturing reimbursement amount and returned it conditional input on criteria radio button input for MVP.

Future research outcomes:
- People expected it to be one claim in two parts rather than our hypothesis of two claims with a link.
