## Why we did this work
This piece of work centers around how to help a processor process a piece of evidence against a set of criteria. We needed iterations on our initial MVP due to both user research findings and buisness decisions.

There was still clarity needed from the buisness on what exactly is the criteria. 

Also our initial assumption was users would be helped by a single question per view. The finding from our first round of processing claims user research was people weren't expecting a series of questions which led to confusion around the same evidence presented on each page.

## What our ideas were

### Combined criteria onto a single screen
#### Assumption:
#### Finding:
#### Iteration on design:
- Due to lack of complete criteria definitions and the complexity identified for MVP this was stripped back to a single question with the complete checks being moved offline.


### Rejection notes per criteria
#### Assumption:
Combining criteria onto a single screen had a impact on rejection notes. Our initial assumption was would want to write rejection notes per criteria. 
#### Finding:
- it was unclear to processers that comments left when a criteria was met would end up being passed to the submitter
- processors would want to edit messages before they were sent to submitters 
#### Iteration on design:
- added edit rejection note view


## What we will do next
- Research needed to understand whether combining the critiera onto one screen improves usability
- Because of tight deadlines this was not tested.
