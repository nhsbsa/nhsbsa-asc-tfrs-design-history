On feedback from research that happened w/c 15 May 2024 we iterated the design. Before we could test these updates though we had a product owner decision that needed to scale even further back to meet delivery deadlines. Thatâ€™s why this is V2, next updates in V3.


## Why we did this work

- [if applicable] Sprint goal and some background for the sprint
- [if applicable] Sprint numbers is spanning over multiple sprints
- Provide key findings of the research and discovery work
- Timelines are an effective way to present the journey the work has taken from initial research to the design
- Insight into your design decisions

## What our ideas were
- Providing visuals of Information architecture
- Including all interactions
- Wireframe and interface ideation
- Hypothesis

## How we tested our ideas and what we found

- Prototype URLs and version numbers must be provided as part of the UCD log
- User testing feedback
- URLs to Miro boards and prototypes where any iteration history is documented

## What we will do next
- For closing comments on the UCD log, give some information on what the next steps are with this piece of work, are there any further iterations that could be made but may not be as high priority just yet, is there further research to be done on a certain part of the design. Talk about things you were not able to do as part of this design that you want to be raised at a later stage and how this has been documented to be revisited.

## Criteria checks against evidence

#### Assumption: 
- Users would be helped by a single question per view.

#### Finding:
- People weren't expecting a series of questions with led to confusion around the evidence presented on each page

#### Iteration on design:
Combined criteria onto a single screen
- Due to lack of complete criteria definitions and the complexity identified for MVP this was stripped back to a single quesiton with the complete checks being moved offline
- Added error states to criteria. 
- Research needed to understand whether combining the critiera onto one screen improves usability
