We had a processing workstream kickoff on ... with the wider product team to begin the processing a claim piece of work. After understanding the constraints and the scope of the journey from multiple buisness and tech perspectives, we had a in-person workshop with the UCD team. We explored ideas of how this journey could look, what are the needs and wants of the users and then stripped it back to the MVP of what we deemed necessary to complete a processing claim journey based off assumptions and hypothesis'. We tested this inital design flow w/c 22 April 2024.

## What claim information does the processor need to process a claim?

#### Hypothesis
Nothing additional is needed by the processor, just the claim status and the claim ID the processor typed in. The processor's task will be to judge the evidence by the criteria and information we give per question and they have no other purpose for more information on this claim details view.
#### To be tested

- Whether users have any other purpose and needs for any additional information about the claim beyond information provided in criteria checks.

## How can a processor effectively view the multiple pieces of evidence?

#### Hypothesis
Looking into how other services present new evidence. Technical constraints of showing in the view. Looked into other services and it was a common pattern to open in new tabs. 

#### To be tested
- Whether opening files in new tabs will pose usability issues.

## What notes are useful for the processor to write/read back in the future?

#### Hypothesis
A feature hypothesised to be very valuable to users, so they can leave context for future viewing on a claim, to log escalations, to add rejection notes. 
Deciding on categories, had many options. Hypothesising on the reasons notes might be added

#### To be tested
- What would a processor need notes for?

#### Screenshots



## How can the processor check the evidence against the criteria?

#### Hypothesis
- Hypothesised one question per page to reduce cognitive load. Research to understand whether criteria checking with one question per page is usable
- is it multiple criteria per piece of evidence or multiple evidence per one piece of criteria. We decided one question for all the evidence. 
- Hypothesis of need a rejection input box to capture each noâ€™s rejection reason. This will generate a rejection note that will be added to notes. 

#### To be tested
- Research to understand how best to capture notes when criteria aren't met.

## How will the processor judge that a claim is approved or rejected?

#### Hypothesis
Flow of predetermined outcome.
That asking single criteria questions per page, need a check your answers to see all at once. And the outcome view is dynamically approved or rejected based off the radio selections. 

#### To be tested
- Research to understand how users perceive prescriptive criteria checks that lead to a predetermined outcome

## Cost per learner

#### Hypothesis
Hypothesised that this is going to be a very tricky part of the journey, very prone to errors, big risk as could end up entering more money than should and bsa will be paying out more than meant to. First stab at content, thinking need this on a separate page to focus the content to help the processor work it out. 

#### To be tested
- Research to understand how to help users identify cost paid by organisation.
