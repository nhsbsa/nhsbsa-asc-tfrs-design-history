## Why we did this work
To support the work to reduce the reliance on offline processes, and to help a organisation and BSA solve a organisation related problem quickly, a feature has been identified of adding the ability to add notes at an organisational level. Currently these notes and records are kept in spreadsheets outside of the processing app.

Now that we have introduced a find an org feature within the processing app, we can now add the notes feature to an org.

## What our ideas were

An early Hypothesis
>**We believe that** the ability for BSA Staff to add and save notes at an organisational level
>**Will be a useful feature for** processors
>**As it will** help the communication between the BSA staff and any updated information can be seen and provided to the organisations

The flexibility and scalability we have built into the view when designing the organisation view to be able to be iterated and built up meant it was a easy decision to add the organisation notes to a new tab.The notes design is one we had already experimented with when adding notes to a claim, and we believed fit the task.

>**We believe that** the information including the note, author, job role, date and time
>**Will be a useful feature for** BSA to staff to see
>**As it will** allow them to see the context of when the note was created, by who, and the contents of what it says.

>**We believe that** showing the organisations workplace id in the add note view and then allowing space for the note details 
>**Will be a useful feature for** BSA to staff 
>**As it will** automatically add the date, time and who they are to the note, and it has a big text input to capture all the details which is enough for them to complete the task.

## How we tested our ideas and what we found
- We tested the org view with CCS agents and processors week commencing 5th January 2025.
- The main themes from the playback:
  - The uncertainties around the notes - is this for the claim or the organisation? Will the organisation see this note? Are these notes from the organisation?
  - Can't access the necessary information on the seperate add note view when writing note to fill in with specific info about a claim or the organisation, so they would potentially still make their own notes offline, or open in a new browser. 

## What we will do next
- We held a post playback actions session with the wider delivery team to decide what actions to progress with.
- We conducted further testing with some processors in a workshop and it was decided the notes in their current design, without further iteration, would not be any better than the processes they already have now. They have been pushed down the roadmap priorities until further time can be spent to iterate the designs.
