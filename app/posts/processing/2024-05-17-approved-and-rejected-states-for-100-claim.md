## Why we did this work

Processors or interested parties will want to come to a processed 100 claim and see all the information as it was processed and why the processor came to that outcome.

## What our ideas were

- Considering the intentions of someone coming to look back at a claim
- Show answers from criteria checks and the no notes/reimbursement amount 
- still want all the information inputted from the claim, just in a frozen state. 
- For MVP it was decided to not view the evidence. This is something added into the backlog as seems vital for reflecting on why a claim was approved or rejected or how will a future processor be able to understand.

## How we tested our ideas and what we found
- In user research. Able to see all the information they needed.
