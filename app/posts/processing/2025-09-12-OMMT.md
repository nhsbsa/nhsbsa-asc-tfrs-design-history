## Why we did this work
Oliver McGowan Mandatory Training (OMMT) focuses on upskilling in Learning Disabilities and Autism and is the government’s recommended package for health and social care staff to meet the training requirement on learning disability and autism under the Health and Care Act 2022. Funding has been made available to the sector to help pay for this required training and the current LDSS service has been identified as the method through which that funding can be delivered to the sector. 

Due to timescales tied to ministerial announcements there was pressure to identify the minimal amount of work needed to allow OMMT to be reimbursed in the service. Tha approach taken was to conduct technical and design spikes to identify the changes needed and highlight risks with the speed of approach as we would be unable to test solutions with users.

OMMT comes in two tiers and unlike other LDSS courses there are two different reimbursement rates depending on the method of delivery:
- internally delivered training
- externally procured training

Any solution would need to allow of these different methods of delivery. In addition internally delivered training does not require evidence of payment and has a fixed reimbursement rate. 

How we deal with this on the submitter side is discussed in the post in Claims [Supporting Oliver McGowan Mandatory Training (Submitter)](../../processing/OMMT).

## What our ideas were
Our design spike showed that processing of OMMT claims could function the same as any other LDSS claims. Despite the requirements of CQC registration and using eligible training providers, there were existing processes that could be utilised to allow processors to process OMMT claims. 

The one exception would be interally delivered OMMT claims, as they don't require evidence of payment the corresponding question is not required as well. This results in a 100 claim that has similarities to a 40 claim as it just has the evidence of completion question. However due to it being a 100 claim still we felt some extra content to explicitly call out that it is a internally delivered OMMT claim and therefore only has evidence of completion.

Along with this change to the processing screen reimbursement rate is calculated slightly differently for internally delierved OMMT claims. Since the organisation doesn't provide evidence of payment the reimbursement is fixed. This meant we would make some small changes to the confirmation screeen on approved a claim.

## What we will do next
As discussed previously we would not have any oppotunity to test these changes with users before releasing the change. However given the close control we have over the operational environment we could much more easily support users. We supports the opertional training team in updating their material and provided information in the comms release to further discuss the changes. Through conversations with the operational trainers they felt that there would be any major issues, given the small changes being made to the processing side and they had plans in place to provide additional support to the processors during the first few weeks of OMMT being released.
