## Why we did this work

To complete the functionality for a 60/40 TU claim to be processed, the 40 part needs to be accounted for in the designs. Because 40 claims are closely linked with 60, they were considered during the design process for 60 to allow for a holistic journey and reduce amount of work needing to be done in the future to update.

## What our ideas were

>**We believe that** the same info about the organisation, training and submitter 
>**Will be needed for** processors
>**As it will** help them follow the same process as they did for 60 with familiarity on layout

>**We believe that** only the evidence of completion and not payment
>**Will be needed for** processors
>**As it will** help that focus on the important information to processing that relevant part of claim

>**We believe that** the yes option having no further input needed
>**Will be needed for** processors 
>**As it will** not need any further information from the processors to calculate the reimbursement amount, this is information already supplied during the 60 part processing.

>**We believe that** reiterating reimbursment amount breakdown
>**Will be needed for** processors 
>**As it will** be very clear what the next steps are and why

>**Will be needed for** future processors 
>**As it will** be very clear on what happened on this claim.

## How we tested our ideas and what we found

- 60 and 40 being seperate wasn't liked as participants thought of them as 

## What we will do next
- Adding content to link 60 and 40 claims together
- Allowing to be searched on with combined claim number

>**We believe that** linking the other part of the 60/40 claim
>**Will be needed for** processors
>**As they will** be able to understand the situation going on with the other part to build the mental scaffolding in their head and see where the other part is up to in processing.
