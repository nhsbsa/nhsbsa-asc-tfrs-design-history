## Why we did this work

CPD has been removed as a option for funding. Version 4 of the prototype has stripped out CPD and this version will act as the new MVP. Version 3 holds the design for the last iteration of CPD.

## What we did
On the processing side this has no effect on the overall design journey as CPD was added in the service onto the TU journey trying to minimise amount of design and tech work needed due to tight delivery deadlines.
