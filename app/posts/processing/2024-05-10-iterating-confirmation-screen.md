On feedback from research that happened w/c 15 May 2024 we iterated the design. Before we could test these updates though we had a product owner decision that needed to scale even further back to meet delivery deadlines. That’s why this is V2, next updates in V3.


## Why we did this work

- [if applicable] Sprint goal and some background for the sprint
- [if applicable] Sprint numbers is spanning over multiple sprints
- Provide key findings of the research and discovery work
- Timelines are an effective way to present the journey the work has taken from initial research to the design
- Insight into your design decisions

## What our ideas were
- Providing visuals of Information architecture
- Including all interactions
- Wireframe and interface ideation
- Hypothesis

## How we tested our ideas and what we found

- Prototype URLs and version numbers must be provided as part of the UCD log
- User testing feedback
- URLs to Miro boards and prototypes where any iteration history is documented

## What we will do next
- For closing comments on the UCD log, give some information on what the next steps are with this piece of work, are there any further iterations that could be made but may not be as high priority just yet, is there further research to be done on a certain part of the design. Talk about things you were not able to do as part of this design that you want to be raised at a later stage and how this has been documented to be revisited.

## Confirmation screen

#### Assumption: 
- Would be wanted to know processing was complete success

#### Finding:
- confirmation screen was of limited use and processors were keen to check that the caim status has been updated 

#### Iteration on design:
- Hypothesis confirmation screen is unnecessary. Doesn’t tell anything. Removed and pass user back to the claim screen with updated status and success banner. 
- Research needed to understand whether removing the confirmation screen and landing the users back on the claim screen met user expectations
