## Why we did this work
We first tested the org view with processors and css agents in February and we disproved the hypothesis that having the find a claim search to find a specific claim would solve the user need. 

It was found
- expectation that they would want to scan a table of all the claims to compare claims for similar training or learners.
- they would want the last opened claim to stay open and not clear when going between tabs

## What our ideas were

Add in claims table
- Couldn't have sort, but can have pagination as that's been added in by development on other tables now.
- All status's in one table, ordered by not yet processed, rejected and then approved.
  - we do know from research that the table will be most used by trying to scan between how claims for similar training was processed so not yet processed claims at the top might not be most useful. But if they werren't at the top they would get buried underneath approved and rejected claims. 
- second round or research said to Change submitted dates to processed, happy to have a line where no date present.
- ordering within the status', decided by dates, processed dates for approved and rejected, submitted date for not yet processed.

UR
Research insight: processors would be less likely toÂ  be looking at not yet processed claims in the table - as they'd be more likely to always search for a claim to process them based on the ID provided by OM...
* And that the examples we have for browsing the table would relate more to processed claims - either via date for QAs to assess the most recent ones or via course title (but I think that could be an unexpected column to be ordered by). 
- My thoughts: not yet processed claims are most useful to be at the top then? but if not then they would get buried under lots of approved and rejected claims
- In the workshop when we were discussing it, there were no suggestions to (or evidence) for us to move them from the top.
- Outcome:
* But I think the table would be ripe for iterations further down the line e.g., sorting by columns etc so we could note to revisit it during any future table iterations Or alongside claim/ org notes later


- they would want the last opened claim to stay open and not clear when going between tabs
- also decided with tech that the processing of a claim would remain with the answers saved until they click into another claim, then the session would refresh.
